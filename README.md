#  Python Learning Repository

Welcome to this repository!  
It’s a growing collection of Python basics, examples, and exercises designed to build a strong foundation before moving into real-world projects.

##  Topics Covered So Far

We’ve explored a wide range of core Python concepts, including:

- **Lists & Arrays** – storing and manipulating collections of data  
- **Dictionaries** – key-value pairs for structured data  
- **Tuples & Stacks** – immutable sequences and stack operations  
- **Functions** – defining and reusing blocks of code  
- **Input & Output** – handling user input and displaying results  
- **File Handling** – reading from and writing to files  
- **Dates & Time** – working with timestamps and formatting  
- **Error Handling** – using `try/except` to manage exceptions  
- **Loops** – `for` and `while` for iteration  
- **Modules** – importing and organizing code  
- **And more…** covering the essentials of Python programming

##  What’s Next?

Now that the basics are in place, the next step is to **dive into projects** that will help solidify this knowledge.  
These projects will be hands-on, practical, and designed to reinforce concepts by applying them in real scenarios.
