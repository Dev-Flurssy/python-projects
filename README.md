# Python Revision Note

This repository contains my personal notes and practice code while revising Python for an interview.  
I’ve added comments throughout the code to make concepts easier to understand and revisit.

## What’s Inside
- Core Python syntax and examples
- Common interview topics (data structures, OOP, error handling, etc.)
- Extra notes and explanations in comments
- Practice problems and solutions

## Purpose
- To reinforce my own understanding of Python
- To serve as a quick reference for revision
- To share with anyone else preparing for Python interviews

## How to Use
Clone the repo and explore the files:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dev-Flurssy/python-projects
